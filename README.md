# fama-french-fintech - Fama-French 5-Factor Industry Analysis

This project uses Python to analyze firm returns by running Fama-French 5-Factor regressions across three industries. It was completed for a Financial Econometrics course.

## Project Summary

**Main Goals:**
- Run five-factor regressions for firms in three industries (Financial Trading, Computer Software, Steel Works).
- Identify which firms have the highest beta to each factor.
- Test the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) hypothesis using J-statistics and p-values.
- Conduct zero-beta hypothesis tests for each factor individually.

**Tools Used:**
- Python 3
- pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, statsmodels

## File Overview
- `Pavankumar_Harikrishna_HW2.py`: Main script that processes data and performs analysis.
- `HW2_535.pdf`: Original homework assignment.
- `data/`: Folder for the datasets used (data files are not included for confidentiality).

## Key Concepts Covered
- Fama-French 5-Factor Model
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression
- J-statistics and p-values for model validation
- Hypothesis Testing in Finance

## How to Run
1. Place the required datasets in a `data/` folder.
2. Make sure Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`) are installed.
3. Run `Pavankumar_Harikrishna_HW2.py` to view outputs for each question.
