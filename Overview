Analyze firm-level returns using Fama-French 5-Factor Model across three specific industries, using monthly U.S. stock data starting from January 2000.

Industries Analyzed:

  48 → Financial Trading

  36 → Computer Software

Main Tasks:

  Five-Factor Regression:
  
  For each industry, run a Fama-French 5-Factor regression for all firms.
  
  Identify the company with the highest beta for each factor.

APT Hypothesis Test:

  Test whether the residual covariance matrix implies model misspecification (using J-statistic and p-value).
  
  Zero-Beta Tests:
  
  Test, for each factor individually, whether its beta is statistically zero.
